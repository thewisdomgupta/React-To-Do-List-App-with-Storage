## Description
This webpage is responsive & having To Do List App. In which you can create a task, update specific task, delete an individual task, delete all task in one go. The most important feature is the localhost facility in ths app. 
I have used below front-end technologies to make this website:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React
* Localhost

<p>
The project To Do List App is a mini project on Recat JS. In which I have used HTML in little amount, CSS for styling and JavaScript for the functionality, React for the combination of HTML, CSS, Java Script and JSX as the syntax extension of Java Script.
